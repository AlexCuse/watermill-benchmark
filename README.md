# Watermill Benchmark
<img align="right" width="200" src="https://threedots.tech/watermill-io/watermill-logo.png">

This is an early set of tools for benchmarking [watermill](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill).

## VM Setup

The project includes [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) definition for setting up an instance on Google Cloud Platform.

It will spin up a fresh Ubuntu 19.04 instance, install docker with dependencies and clone this repository.

Set environment variables:

```bash
# path to GCP credentials file
TF_VAR_credentials_path=
# project name on GCP
TF_VAR_project=
# public part of the key that you will use to access SSH
TF_VAR_pub_key_path=
```

Create the VM:

```bash
cd setup
terraform apply
```

The command will output the public IP address of the server. Use ssh with user `benchmark` to access it.

After running all benchmarks, destroy the VM:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Configuration

### Google Pub/Sub

Set environment variables in `compose/.env`:

```bash
# path to json file within the project with GCP credentials
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=compose/key.json
# project name on GCP
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=
```

## Running

Run benchmarks with:

```bash
./run.sh <pubsub>
```
